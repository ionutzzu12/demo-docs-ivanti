Administrators can manually change a device's name (not using the Edit Device Name configuration).

**Applicable to:**

- iOS Supervised devices
- macOS 10.10+ devices

**Procedure**

1. Go to **Devices**.
2. Find the entry for the device in the list.
3. Perform one of the following steps:
   - Add the **Device Name** column if not already added by clicking the Settings gear icon on the right and selecting **Device Name**.
   - Click the link in the **Name** column to go the device details page.
4. Next to the Device Name, click the **Edit** pencil icon.
5. Enter a new device name and click the tick icon.
6. In the Overwrite Device Name display box, review the notes and click **OK**.

The changed name will be pushed to the device the next time it checks in. This action cannot be undone.

If a Default Device Name configuration was previously configured, this action will overwrite the name set in the configuration.
