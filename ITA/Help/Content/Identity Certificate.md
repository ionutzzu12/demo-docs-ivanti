This section contains the following topics:

An identity certificate configuration defines a certificate authentication mechanism for mobile devices. Identity certificates are X.509 certificates (.p12 or .pfx). Also, the identity certificates can be generated dynamically using the [**Certificate Authority**](<./Certificate Management.md>) as a source. Before beginning, you should already know how you plan to distribute certificates to your mobile devices. You should also have configured any necessary certificate authority.

Starting from release 91, the Device Identity certificate for Apple devices is automatically renewed within 30 days of expiry. iOS devices receive renewed MDM certificates from Ivanti Neurons for MDM as part of the regular device check-in flow. However, iOS devices need to be re-enrolled with Ivanti Neurons for MDM when they are offline long enough for the MDM certificate to expire before a check-in that would have renewed the certificate before expiration.

- SHA-1 certificates are deprecated while creating the identity certificates. You can choose other algorithms. While updating the certificates, if the older certificates use SHA-1, the same SHA-1 algorithm can be used. If the older certificates use an algorithm above SHA-1, then switching to SHA-1 is not allowed.
- After configuring an identity certificate, you can click **Test Configuration and continue** to issue and verify the validity of the test certificate. An error may display by performing this test for a new or an existing dynamically generated identity certificate configuration if the subject name is the same as the local certificate authority. When this error message is displayed you should modify the identity certificate subject name which should be different from the local certificate authority subject name. For existing identity certificate configurations that are modified with the subject name, the certificates are re-issued and the configurations are re-pushed.

  If you have setup the option to create a configuration without issuing test certificate for **Dynamically Generated** certificate distribution, click **Continue**.
- Certificates will be re-issued implicitly.
- When Identity certificates are assigned to Android apps, the user's app get Identity certificates without prompting the users to grant the permission (rather than app) to use the certificate. It includes all apps like Email+, Gmail, etc.
- Email+ can be configured with a user provided identity certificate and pushed and assigned as an app configuration to Android enterprise devices. It is applicable only to Work Profile on Company Owned Device and Device Owner modes.
