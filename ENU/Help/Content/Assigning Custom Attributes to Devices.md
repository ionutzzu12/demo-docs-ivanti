You can assign custom device attributes such as internal ID to one or more devices. Each attribute has a corresponding value that you can use for tasks like creating configurations and device groups. After you create custom attributes, you can assign them to devices. For more information about managing attributes, see Attributes.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the Administrative portal.
2. Go to **Devices**.
3. Select one or more devices.
4. Click **Actions**.
5. Select **Assign Custom Attributes**.
6. Select *one* of the following options:
   - Force assign (overwrite) all attributes even if any existing values are found.
   - Overwrite only if value is empty, and skip attributes with existing values.
7. Select the attributes you want to assign and enter their values (empty values are not allowed).
8. Click **Assign**.

The **Custom Device Attributes** with their values can be exported to CSV format from the **Device Details** page.
