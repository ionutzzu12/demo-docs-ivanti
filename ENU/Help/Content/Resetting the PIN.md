The administrator can reset the PIN for a Windows mobile device. A new PIN will be generated for the device. This feature may be useful in situations such as when the user leaves the organization without resetting the PIN of a company-owned device.

**Procedure**

1. Go to **Devices**.
2. Click the user name the device is associated with to view the device details page.
3. In the General section, in the PIN row, click **Reset**.
4. In the PIN Reset window, select the checkbox to confirm the PIN reset.
5. Click **Yes, proceed**.

This process may take several minutes. Ensure the device is turned ON. From the device details page, click **View** to view the newly assigned PIN after reset.
