The following proxy can be used to generate a list of all concepts (and associated text) in your project. Optional Task: You can select a style to affect the look of the entire list. To do this, right-click on the proxy below and select **Edit Concepts Proxy**. Then choose the appropriate style. If you need help, press **F1** when the dialog is open. When you are ready, you can delete this paragraph or replace it with your own text. **Note:** If you cannot see the proxy below, make sure your markers are turned on. To do this, in the local toolbar click the down arrow next to the **Show Tags** button and select **Show Markers**.
