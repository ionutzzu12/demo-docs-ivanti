Windows Desktop apps can be large, adding extra and extended load on networks and servers during key use times for the enterprise. Windows app scheduling feature allows you to schedule a time to install apps, especially large apps, on devices during a time you choose.

To configure app scheduling:

1. Go to **Apps > App Catalog**.
2. Click **Add** and select a Windows app and continue with the next steps in **Add App** wizard.
3. In step 5(Configure), click **Install Application configuration settings** to view the **Configuration Setup** page.
4. Select the **Schedule Installation** checkbox.
   **Schedule Installation** checkbox is displayed only when Silent installation is enabled.

5. Select a **Start Time** and a **End Time** to schedule the time to install apps.
6. Select a **Start Date** and a **End Date** to schedule the date to install apps.
   You can also select one of the following two actions that should be performed when the scheduled date is missed: **Install during next check-in** or **Do not install**.
7. Select an App Configuration distribution option: **Everyone with App**, **No One**, or **Custom**.
8. Click **Done**.
   Apps that need to be scheduled should not be added into Apps\@Work.
   App scheduling is not applicable for Store apps since silent installation of Store apps is not supported.
