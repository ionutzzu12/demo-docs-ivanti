**License**: Silver

A managed domain configuration enables you to specify which domains are trusted for Mail and Safari on iOS 8+ and visionOS 1.1+ devices. Once the configuration is applied to the device, domains that are not specified in the configuration will be highlighted (untrusted) in Mail and Safari on the device. Use this configuration combined with a [**restrictions configuration**](<./iOS Restrictions.md>) to control the data downloads allowed in Safari.
