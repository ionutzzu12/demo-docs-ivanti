**License:** Silver

To control which apps are installed on devices, you create an Allowed Apps policy. This policy also supports MobileIron Packager (MIP) in-house macOS apps. The policy contains the following information:

- Allowlist apps
- Blockedlist apps
- required apps
- compliance actions

If an app is both required and Blockedlisted, then the evaluation of the app against the required list takes precedence. For example, if an app A1 is present in both in the required list and the Blockedlist, then the apps policy evaluation for this device behaves as follows:

- Device will be compliant if A1 is installed on the device.
- Device will be non-compliant if A1 is not installed on the device.

## Supported Devices

- Android 4.2 or supported newer versions
- iOS 8.0  or supported newer versions
- macOS 10.12 or supported newer versions
- Windows 10 or supported newer versions

**Prerequisites**

- The [**privacy configuration**](<./Privacy Configuration.md>) assigned to a device must allow collection of app information in order for an Allowed Apps policy to work correctly. Check the privacy configurations assigned to the devices to which you will apply the Allowed Apps policy.

If you are not sure which configurations are affected:

1. Go to **Policies**.

2. Click **Allowed Apps**.

3. Under **Privacy Configurations**, note the configurations that need to be edited.
4. Go to **Configurations**.
5. For each privacy configuration you noted:
   1. Select the configuration.
   2. Click **Edit**.
   3. Under **Collect App Inventory,** select **For All Apps on the Device**.
   4. Click **Done**.

   - Click **Add Manually** to choose apps by entering the bundle ID for Android, Windows, iOS or macOS system apps.
6. Select the **Add App Lists** tab and then select the desired required apps lists.
7. Use the resultant fields to select the required apps or apps lists.
8. Click the **View Required List** tab for a list of apps you have selected so far.
   Click **Next**

8. Select whether to create a Allowlist or a Blockedlist.
9. You cannot have both a Allowlist and a Blockedlist for a device simultaneously. Creating a Allowlist means all other apps are Blockedlisted.
   Use the **Allowlist/Blockedlist Apps and App Lists** section to select apps and apps lists.
   - Select the **Add App Lists** tab and then select the desired apps lists.
10. Use the resultant fields to select the required apps or apps lists.
11. Click the **View Allowlist or Blockedlist** tab for a list of apps you have selected so far.
    Click **Next**.
12. Select the actions to take when a device is out of compliance:
