This section contains the following topics:

- Adding a category
- Removing a category

Categories describe types of apps and help organize apps when users browse the app catalog. Every app must have at least one category assigned. A list of common app categories is available when you start using Ivanti Neurons for MDM. Use this page to manage app categories.

## [****](#)Adding a category

You can add new categories here, or when you add an app to the [**app catalog**](<./App Catalog.md>).

1. Click **Add** (bottom left)
2. Type the category name.
3. Categories are not case sensitive, so MINE is the same as Mine.
   Click **Save**.

## [****](#)Removing a category

- Click the X next to the category.
