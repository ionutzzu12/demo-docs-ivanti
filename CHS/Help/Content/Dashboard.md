The dashboard shows important statistics about registered devices and users. Each section on the dashboard is called a widget. For each widget, you define:

- the category of data displayed (such as devices or users)
- how the data is grouped (such as by OS build version or model)
- how the data is filtered (such as displaying only iOS devices or display by OS build version)
- how the data is displayed (such as the pie chart or bar chart)

This section contains the following topics:

- Working with Widgets
- App Insights
- Using Scheduled Reports
- Using Custom Reports
