You can trigger the screen lock on a device. Locking works somewhat differently on different devices.

**Procedure**

1. Go to **Devices > Devices**.
2. Select the device.
3. Click **Actions**.
4. Select **Lock**.
5. Alternatively, click the device name link to go to the Device details page and click the **Lock** ![](Lock_device_icon.png) icon and click **OK**.
6. For AppConnect Android apps, the Lock command locks the user out of the container and also locks the device. The users can log back in to the device and the AppConnect app using the device passcode and the AppConnect passcode respectively.
7. For iOS 7 devices, you can enter a display message and phone number (optional).

   These options can give device users information about why the device has been locked and the number to call to get it unlocked.
8. For macOS devices, the user is prompted to enter a 6-digit PIN as passcode to access the device. To proceed with the screen lock, the device user needs to:
   1. Enter the PIN.
   2. Select the check box to confirm locking the device.
   3. Click **Yes, send lock command**.
9. In macOS, user can add optional lock screen message and phone number during device lock passcode setting.
10. For ChromeOS devices, when you perform a Lock operation, a pop up window "Locking a device may require the user to enter a passcode to access the device." appears on the screen. Click **Lock** and the device status will be updated to **Disable sent**, and the updated device status will be visible after periodic device sync.

Alternate Methods of Locking a Device:

- A device user can perform the lock action from the Self Service Portal.
- An Administrator can perform the lock action from the Administrator Portal.
