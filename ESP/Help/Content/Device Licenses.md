device-based licenses define the number of devices you can register, the amount of content you can configure for distribution to devices, and which features are available. If you reach your limit for devices, a red triangle displays in the Admin page. If you reach your limit for content, the service will prevent you from adding more and display a message to indicate that you have reached your limit.
