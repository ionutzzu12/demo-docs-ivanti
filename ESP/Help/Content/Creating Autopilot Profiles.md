The administrator can create Autopilot Profiles on Windows devices. As a prerequisite, the Entra ID User Source must be configured.

**Procedure**

1. Go to **Admin > Microsoft Azure > Autopilot**.
   If the Entra ID User Source is not configured, the **Add** button will be disabled. You need to configure the User Source using the **Entra ID User Source** option present under the **Microsoft Azure** section.
2. Click **Add**.
   The **Add Windows Autopilot Profile** page appears on the screen.
3. Enter a profile name in the **Name** box.
4. Complete the **Profile Settings** using the table below:
5. Click **Next**.
   A new page with all the Entra ID Groups appears on the screen.
6. Select the one or more Entra ID groups to which the Autopilot Profile must be assigned.
7. In case you want to assign the Autopilot Profile to all the Entra ID Groups, select the **Assign to all Entra ID Groups** option.
8. Click **Done**.

| **Device Type**                               | Select one of the following two options depending on the device: <br />* **Windows PC**
* **HoloLens** - When this option is selected, the default deployment mode should be set to **Self-Deploying** mode.<br />In rare cases, when enrolling HoloLens 2 devices using Autopilot, the enrollment might get stuck on the 'Setting up your device for work' screen. In such a rare case, the user must power off and on the device by pressing the Power button. The device then shows the Login screen where the user should enter the Entra ID credentials to complete the enrollment. |
| **Deployment mode**                           | - **Self-Deploying**: In this mode, the device deployment happens with little or no involvement of a user.
- **User-Driven**: In this mode, the user can control the configuration of new Windows devices to make them usable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **User account type**                         | * **Administrator**: Select this option if the user needs complete control once the device is deployed.
* **Standard**: Select this option if the user needs authorization to the basic options once the device is deployed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Language**                                  | By default, the language will be Operating system specific. You can change to a different language from the list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
