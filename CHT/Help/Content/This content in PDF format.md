A third-party vendor translates this Administrator Guide into many languages. The accelerated release cadence of Ivanti Neurons for MDM means that sometimes there is a delay in publishing translated content. If your non-English Administrator Guide is out of date, please access the latest content in the English language by accessing the URL, http\://\[base Administrator Guide URL]/xx/all/en/desktop/Welcome.htm where \[base Administrator Guide URL] is the address after http\:// and before the latest Ivanti Neurons for MDM version number, and xx is the latest version number of Ivanti Neurons for MDM. For example, to access release 80 online help, the URL would be http\://\[base Administrator Guide URL]/80/all/en/desktop/Welcome.htm.
