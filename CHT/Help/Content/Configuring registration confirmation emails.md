## Configuring and using registration confirmation emails

Administrators can configure and trigger emails to users after they have completed registration. This email can contain, for example, additional instructions for users after having successfully registered. Administrators can enable sending of this email during user invitation.

The process:

- **Configuring the feature:**
  - Configure the email template: The English email template looks like this by default, but you can revise it to better suit your purposes by following the instructions at Customizing an email template in Branding Email Templates.
