You can apply ChromeOS configuration on specific devices. However, the device must belong to an LDAP User Group. When you try to apply the ChromeOS Blueprint Configuration, only the User Groups section will be available, and all the LDAP User Groups will be listed under the section. You can select one or more from the listed groups and apply the configuration.
